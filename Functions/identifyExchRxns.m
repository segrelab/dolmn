%%identifyExchRxns Identify exchange and "medium" reactions.

%
%By default, identifyExchRxns assumes that exchange reactions are written
%as export reactions: 'A <==>'; therefore, uptaking a metabolite is a
%negative flux and the stoichiometric coefficient of metabolite A is -1.
%
%REQUIRED INPUT
% The model structure must contain the following fields:
%   model.S: Stoichiometric matrix
%
%OPTIONAL INPUTS
% The model structure my contain the following fields:
%   model.lb: Lower bounds. Must be included if would like to know med_rxns
%   model.c: Objective coefficient. If included, makes sure biomass is 
%       excluded from exch_rxns
% exch_mets: Exchange metabolite indices of interest (numeric array)
%
%OUTPUT
% exch_rxns: Vector with indices of the exchange reactions
% med_rxns: Vector with indices of the medium reactions (model can use)
%   Need to include model.lb to compute
